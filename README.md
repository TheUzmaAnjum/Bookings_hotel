# Hotel-bookings
A project on R programming

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of booking patterns, customer demographics, and factors influencing hotel reservations. The dataset included information on booking dates, customer nationality, length of stay, and booking status, among other variables. The project began with data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was then conducted using R's powerful libraries like 'ggplot2' and 'dplyr' to visualize trends and relationships. Key visualizations included bar charts showing booking counts by country, line graphs depicting seasonal trends in reservations, and scatter plots illustrating the relationship between lead time and booking cancellations.

The findings provided valuable insights for hotel management, such as identifying peak booking periods, understanding the impact of lead time on cancellations, and tailoring marketing strategies to different customer segments. The project demonstrated the effectiveness of R in handling, analyzing, and visualizing complex datasets to derive actionable business insights.
